My plan for the Mixed messages Project

- Create a random text generator that describes how certain celebrities deciced to do normal everyday activiites in ridiculous ways.
- Start each generated text with the phrase "Can you believe...."

- Randomly choose a celebrity out of a list:
	
	* Tom Cruise
	* David Beckham
	* Jennifer Aniston
	* Halle Berry
	* Rihanna
	* Jim Carey
	* Ryan Gosling
	* Mila Kunis
	* Leonardo DiCaprio 
	* Cristiano Ronaldo
	* Scarlett Johansson
	* Dwayne Johnson 
	 
- Randomly choose initial start of the statement out of:

	* decided to
	* thought it would be a good idea to
	* happened to
	* seemed to think that they should 

- Randomly choose a everyday activiy out of:

	* hoover their house
	* walk their dog
	* clean their car
	* cook some dinner
	* take a shower
	* brush their teeth
	* take the bins out

- Randomly choose a ridiculous action out of:

	* whilst playing the flute
	* whilst wearing a nappy on their head
	* whilst drizzling chocolate sauce over themselves
	* whilst trying to balance a melon on their head
	* whilst wearing a morph suit
	* whilst blowing up baloons
	* whilst juggling some oranges


Create a function that:


 - uses Math.floor(Math.Random()) to generate a random number depending on array length.
 - creates an empty array for each element to store possible answers (pushing them based on random number).
 - returns concatenation of the strings generated from the arrays and adds "!!??" to the end of the string.
